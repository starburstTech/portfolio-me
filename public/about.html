<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a full-stack developer with a strong QA/SDET foundation, building web
  applications end-to-end with a focus on reliability and user experience. I
  have led cross-functional teams, designed scalable automation frameworks, and
  shipped features in fast-paced, Agile environments. My approach blends clean
  front-end experiences with robust back-end services and a quality-first
  mindset.
</p>

<p>
  I work across the stack with JavaScript, Java, REST APIs, and SQL, and I bring
  deep testing expertise with Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, TestNG, and
  REST-Assured. I am comfortable with CI/CD and cloud testing using Azure
  DevOps, Jenkins, and BrowserStack, and I apply TDD/BDD practices to keep code
  maintainable and production-ready.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy turning complex requirements into simple, scalable solutions and
  continuously improving delivery pipelines. If you are looking for someone who
  can build features and ensure they work flawlessly, I would love to connect.
