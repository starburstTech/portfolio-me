    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Full-Stack Developer + QA/SDET</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I am a full-stack developer with a strong QA/SDET foundation, building web
      applications end-to-end with a focus on reliability and user experience. I
      have led cross-functional teams, designed scalable automation frameworks,
      and shipped features in fast-paced, Agile environments. My approach blends
      clean front-end experiences with robust back-end services and a
      quality-first mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work across the stack with JavaScript, Java, REST APIs, and SQL, and I
      bring deep testing expertise with Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, TestNG,
      and REST-Assured. I am comfortable with CI/CD and cloud testing using
      Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and BrowserStack, and I apply TDD/BDD practices to
      keep code maintainable and production-ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy turning complex requirements into simple, scalable solutions and
      continuously improving delivery pipelines. If you are looking for someone
      who can build features and ensure they work flawlessly, I would love to
      connect.
